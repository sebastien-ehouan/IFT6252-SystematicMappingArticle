<h1> Recommendation Systems for Software Quality in IDEs</h1>
<h3> A Systematic Mapping Study</h3>
<p> Developing modern software systems is a complex task. Developers have to constantly think about different contexts to achieve their task. Integrated development environments contribute to alleviate development tasks. A key element affecting the development and maintenance of a software system is the notion of software quality. Thus, in this article, we propose to do a survey of existing recommendation systems aimed to assist developers in improving software quality in the context of integrated development environments. Using a systematic process, we conducted a overview of 391 papers and classified 46 into relevant categories. We find that sustained efforts are proposed to assist developers using many different methods in various domains and areas. Unfortunately, only a few of these systems seems to end up gaining traction in the industry or academia.</p>
